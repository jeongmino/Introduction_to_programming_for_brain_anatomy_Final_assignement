## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the BRI 519 course to demonstrate core concepts in data processing, analysis, and reproducible computational workflows. The goal of the project is to provide a structured and well-documented codebase that can be easily understood, executed, and extended by other users.

The project emphasizes clarity, modular design, and reproducibility, making it suitable for both educational and experimental purposes.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`  
  Contains the main source code files implementing the core functionality of the project.

- `data/`  
  Stores input datasets and any intermediate data files used during analysis.

- `notebooks/`  
  Includes Jupyter notebooks used for exploration, analysis, and visualization.

- `requirements.txt`  
  Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.

- `README.md`  
  Provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage examples.
